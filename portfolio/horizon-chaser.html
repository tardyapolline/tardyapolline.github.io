    <div class="text-block-23">Realtime WebXR Project<br>Creative Director, Concept Artist: Apolline Tardy<br>3D Artist (Texture, Lighting, Animation): Ayushman Johri<br>Commissioned for a leading tech company&#x27;s new VR platform (under NDA).</div>
    <div class="text-block-2">Going from Bennington College to Carnegie Mellon University was like crossing a bridge between two completely different worlds. At Bennington, a liberal arts college nestled in the Vermont mountains, learning was slow, intentional, and deeply connected to nature. My days were filled with quiet discovery—leafing through books under open skies, practicing Chinese calligraphy on chalkboards, and painting landscapes en plein air. In contrast, CMU thrived on a future-oriented culture, speed and technology. I moved from the pages of linguistics books to the interfaces of corpus analysis software and data concordancers. I experimented with platforms like Figma and Adobe Illustrator to expand my artistic vocabulary. While visiting the <a href="https://www.etc.cmu.edu/" class="link-23">Entertainment Technology Center</a> (ETC), I discovered a community of artists adapting traditional creative tools to the digital sphere, and what I thought was a leap into the unknown became a bridge.<br><br>Of all artistic fields, Extended Reality (XR) captured my imagination the most. XR turns art into an experience, allowing you to step into it and explore an artist&#x27;s vision firsthand. Free from the static confines of walls and galleries, it is like a portable experience that can be accessed anywhere. I was eager to dive into XR, and I knew the best way to learn would be by creating. As I brainstormed where to begin, my mind settled on a train wagon—a small, rectangular space that felt simple yet full of potential. Unlike a static room, a wagon carries the thrill of motion and the promise of adventure. Trains are powerful symbols of exploration, and in virtual reality, they could become so much more, as vehicles for traveling through new dimensions. I imagined a vintage train, where its ornate interior would be a prelude to f destinations. This train wouldn’t just transport passengers; it would carry them into a story. With the 3D technical skills of ETC alumni Ayushman Johri, my vision came to life as Horizon Chaser.</div>

    <h2 class="heading-23"><strong>From Paper to Pixels</strong></h2>
    <div class="text-block-24">To design the wagon’s interior, I created a slide deck to outline every detail I imagined. I gathered reference images of vintage trains as a starting point. From there, I explored various designs, fabrics, textures, and colors that felt both magical and grounded in a vintage aesthetic. I imagined dark, timeworn wood paired with velvet fabrics in rich shades of crimson red, midnight blue, and deep pea green, accented with gold details. The contrast of matte, porous surfaces with shiny metal would add visual depth and complexity to the interior. The design process felt like solving a series of creative puzzles. Some elements clicked easily, while others required piecing together inspiration from multiple references. I wanted to design an environment that was otherworldly and luxurious, yet still welcoming to the audience. When photographic references weren’t enough, I sketched original designs to fit seamlessly into the wagon’s architecture, like partitions that aligned with the curves of the ceiling and walls. Ayushman used them as alpha masks for the 3D models. At times, I found inspiration in unexpected places: casino interiors, antique apothecaries, pawn shops (the clock and the gramophone), and even props from old movies (the compass). Some elements were entirely reimagined, like the metal fence patterns which I turned into motifs for the curtains and table lamps.</div>

    <h2 class="heading-23"><strong>Dreaming of Time</strong></h2>
    <div class="text-block-24">Time flows differently aboard Horizon Chaser. Its key assets—a clock, a compass, a calendar, and a barometer—are not the ones we know. The clock ticks backward at an accelerated pace, inscribed with the words “Somnium Temporis”—dreaming of time. The compass, engraved with the phrase “Let the Horizon be your Guide,” seems sentient, and spins as though searching for something it cannot find. The calendar flips endlessly through dates, never settling. These assets, meant to orient and ground the audience, instead transport them beyond simple coordinates, suggesting a journey through abstract realms. At the heart of this experience is the tension between structure and unpredictability, which captures what draws me most to XR: its ability to play around the linear constraints of time. Through the train windows, bursts of light cut through the darkness. Are these stars? Tunnel lights? The ambiguity was intentional, designed to evoke both wonder and curiosity, inviting the audience to move through time, space, or an unexplored reality. <br><br><em>Work in progress: Horizon Chaser is currently under commission for a new VR platform launch for a leading tech company (under NDA). Future directions include proximity based animations and sound design. </em></div>
