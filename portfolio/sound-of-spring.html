    <h2 class="heading-14">7 Minute Film, Released May 2022<br>Production, Editing, and Sound Design by Apolline Tardy</h2>
    <div class="text-block-2">For the closing assignment of Professor <a href="https://www.senempirler.com/" target="_blank" class="link-3">Senem Pirler</a>’s Sound Design for Moving Images course, I chose to conclude my studies with a bold experiment: a silent film. After months of experimenting with sound design: foley art, sound effects editing, post-processing and sound mixing, field recording techniques, and soundscaping,... I felt a void, one that could only be filled by the perspective of a deaf student. And so began my journey into the ways sound can be experienced without hearing, leading to the creation of a film that may be silent to the ear but rich and resonant to the remaining senses.<br><br>Pirler had given us many exercises during the semester, my favorite being field recording. It was like a treasure hunt, with every sound a buried treasure only waiting to be unearthed with patience and careful listening, and the Bennington College campus a vast map full of sonic riches. For the final assignment, I chose not a microphone, but a camera as my instrument. The winters in Vermont are relentless, their icy grip lingering long after the calendar says it should end. But when I raised my camera, the thaw began, revealing the earth&#x27;s first brushstrokes of life and color. Enchanted by the moment, I started recording The Sound of Spring.</div>

    <h2 class="heading-18">Listening without Ears</h2>
    <div class="text-block-3"><strong>‍</strong>The Sound of Spring invites the audience to “listen” to the world through deaf ears, embracing it as a meaningful and valid way of hearing. I believe that deafness opens doors to deeper listening. When the world cannot reach you through your ears, it will reach you through its touch, as a gentle tap on your shoulder as if to say, “I am here.” Its <em>temperature</em> will tell you the changing moods of the sky, and when the world is in transition, as the winter loosens its grip and the spring awakens. Its <em>texture</em> will tell you of the ground’s low voice, the gravelly terrain gripping at your steps, etching its ridges onto your soles, the soil yielding and crumbling under your stride, and the pliant grass bending momentarily before springing back. Its <em>resonance</em> will tell you of the branches swaying as you rest against a tree trunk, of water rushing underneath you as you cross a wooden bridge, and of an insect buzzing as it lands on the flower you hold. When your ears do not hear the world, the rest of your body will.</div>
    <h2 class="heading-16">Whispers of the Mind</h2>
    <div class="text-block-4">Without auditory input, the brain paints its own soundtrack. Without my hearing aids, I experience phantom noises when I see evidence of sound but my ears do not detect it. I wondered if by making a silent film, my audience would experience this too. When I shared my idea with Pirler, she introduced me to Christine Sun Kim’s videography that experiments with many visual representations of sound, including captions. Captions are a tool for sensory input which offers many creative opportunities. As language, they have the power to tap into the imagination. Rather than exposing its audience to a sound, they demand a sound to be created in their minds. I thought it would be an exciting terrain to explore. For my film project, I filmed a clip a day for 3 weeks, searching for multisensory evidence of sound in my surroundings. At times, I would put sunscreen on my phone to blur out the scene, as an attempt to accentuate the lighting and movement. I tried to bring attention to texture without revealing the entire scene, and to script a soundscape in coherence and complementary to the image. Exploring the art of captioning, I played with personifications, metaphors and onomatopoeias. I also attempted to enhance the sonic experience with notions of temperature, shape and mood.</div>
    <h2 class="heading-19">Audiology and Ideology</h2>
    <div class="text-block-5">My exclusion from the phonocentric world has made me passionate about the ways sound is constructed, viewed and understood, culturally, linguistically, politically and socially. It has led me to believe that the act of hearing is as much a sensory experience as it is a cultural and ideological phenomenon. My senior thesis at Bennington was about the metaphysics of audism. My research was driven by one simple, yet thought-provoking question: “what does it mean to hear?”. It explored the conceptualization of hearing as a sensory experience, drawing a line between audiology and ideology. A brief look into neuroscience showed that senses are not islands that work on their own, rather, they are signals which are intertwined from the moment they enter the brain. Those with sensory disabilities are often aware that auditory, kinesthetic and visual information are merged into a unified, integrated percept. I used narratives of multisensory cooperation as evidence that you don’t need eyes to see, a tongue to taste, or ears to hear. The answer to “what does it mean to hear” depends on how we name sound, what the meaning and history the names carry means to us and the world, how identity is built upon the latter, and how we feel about that identity ourselves. It is inseparable from our awareness of other ways of hearing, of our attention, embodied actions, and ultimately, which sensory “circuits” we travel on. </div>
